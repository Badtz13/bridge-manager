<!--
Do not submit anything unrelated to bbctl here.

For issues with self-hosting bridges with a self-hosted Matrix server (outside Beeper),
refer to the official bridge repositories under github.com/mautrix.

For issues with bridges built into Beeper, as well as Beeper client issues
unrelated to bridges, use the "Report a problem" button in the clients.

For any other Beeper-related questions, email support@beeper.com
or ask in the Beeper Community room.

Also, for setup issues related to bbctl, it's often quicker to
ask in #self-hosting:beeper.com than creating an issue.
